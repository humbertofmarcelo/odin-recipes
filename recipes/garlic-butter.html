</li>
                <li>Add 3 tbsps. of the butter to a soup pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and seasonings. Stir continuously until the butter starts to foam.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken broth, half and half, soy sauce, and bouillon cube.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil and add the pasta. Bring back to a gentle boil and cook uncovered according to package instructions.

                <li>Reduce heat to low and gradually stir in the Parmesan cheese. Remove from heat and add the lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and cover the pot to let it melt. Gently stir it into the pasta and serve!</li>
