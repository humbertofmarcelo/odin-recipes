                <li>½ cup sour cream</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep Work</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350° F.</li>
                <li>For the biscuit layer: Use a frozen stick of butter for this recipe if possible. Otherwise, place a stick of butter in the freezer until ready to use. Combine sour cream, milk, and honey in a small bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Make the Filling</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the sugar and cornstarch to a large bowl and mix until well-combined. Add the blueberries, lemon juice, and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Transfer to a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish.</li>
            </ol>          
            <li>Make the Topping</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            
                <li>Cut the cold butter into small cubes (or if frozen, shred it with a cheese grater) and add it to the bowl with the dry ingredients. If it's cubed, use a pastry cutter or the back of a fork to work it until coarse crumbs form. If shredded, simply mix to combine with the dry ingredients.</li>
            
                <li>Add the chilled sour cream/milk/honey mixture. Use a silicone spatula to gently stir until just combined. Don’t overmix. It should be crumbly.</li>

                <li>Take small handfuls of the biscuit dough and arrange it over the cobbler, covering up most of the filling. (It’s best for this to look rustic and not perfect!)</li>

                <li>Whisk together the egg and the milk and use a pastry brush to brush a light layer over the top. Sprinkle with sugar.</li>
            </ol>              
            <li>Bake and Serve</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Bake uncovered for 45-55 minutes, until the top is golden, the filling is hot and bubbly, and a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the biscuit topping.</li>

                <li>Let cool for 5 minutes and serve with a side of vanilla ice cream!</li>
             </ol>                       
        </ul>
